# microtone

## What is this?

A silly single-serving website for playing about with the WebAudio API in JavaScript and making something approximating music.

"Approximating" being the operative word, since we've manged the code to make it [19 tone equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_equal_temperament) for microtonal experimentation.

If you prefer conventional music, maybe check out [ashe.org.uk/tone](https://ashe.org.uk/tone) instead...
